By reading this, as a system designer you are less likely to rely on the Framework in ways which would make your system and your end users vulnerable.</p> <p>The scenarios are ordered according to the strength of the adversary, weakest to strongest. This threat model technique is based on research published by Taylor Hornby - Defuse Security, 6 Mar 2017<a href="https://defuse.ca/audits/gocryptfs.htm" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer alternate">[1]</a>.</p> <h3 id="bob-the-block-explorer"><a href="#bob-the-block-explorer" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Bob: the block explorer</h3> <p>Bob watches the entirety of transactions published on the public blockchain and your implementation publishes imprints as part of the 0xcert Framework Assets. Bob is able to see every transaction, including historical transactions, the old versions of Assets that have been modified and Assets that have been burned. Bob does not have access to any proofs.</p> <h4 id="document-version-tracking"><a href="#document-version-tracking" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Document version tracking</h4> <p>Bob will not be able to learn any parts of the document. However he will be able to see how often the document changes. If your application is an append-only list of information inside a document and each append operation is a blockchain transaction then Bob can accurately guess the number of items on your list by watching the number of transactions.</p> <p>💡 Mitigation: You may create decoy transactions which modify an unimportant part of the document. This now means Bob may only accurately guess a lower bound on the list size</p> <p>💡 Mitigation: You may batch transactions which modify any important parts of the document. This now means Bob may only accurately guess an upper bound on the list size.</p> <p>If you use these two mitigations together then Bob is unable to make any bound on the actual list size.</p> <h3 id="transactor-tracking"><a href="#transactor-tracking" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Transactor tracking</h3> <p>If you are using the Ethereum or Wanchain blockchains or similar, Bob will see which entity commited each transaction. This is a fundamental property of how blockchains works. If your application publishes documents which are imprinted in a 0xcert Framework Asset and a part of that document includes the identity of the publisher then Bob would be able to guess the part of the document representing the document publisher insofaras it is equal to the identity of the person performing the blockchain transaction.</p> <p>💡 Mitigation: You may use an Order Gateway and claims to create Assets. In this senario, the publisher would create a claim and a separate entity (your application) would publish the transaction to the blockchain. The identity of the beneficial publisher can be hidden in several ways using this technique.
